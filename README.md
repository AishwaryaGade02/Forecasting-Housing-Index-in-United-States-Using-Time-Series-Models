## Abstract :
 This project aims to conduct a time series analysis of the United States Housing Price Index
 using data that was originally obtained from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).
 The method of maximum likelihood is used to estimate the parameters and to forecast the
 housing price index for the future. This dataset has monthly data from January 1991 to April
 2013. Through the analysis, it is revealed that the ARI(1,1) model explains the trend of
 Housing Price Index(HPI) more adequately when compared to other simple time series
 models. Through this model, it is evident how slowly and constantly the HPI increases with
 time under assumption of the economic conditions, housing inventory, landscape availability
 and government policies remain constant in the future. This model can be useful for
 accessing house value by the owners to increase and decrease the values of the house,
 analyzing real estate investments, policy making and urban planning to monitor house market
 stability, making informed buying and selling decisions, and for making mortgage and
 lending decisions.
